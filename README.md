Description
===========

`certificates` is an ansible role which was built to help you with:

 * coping of certficates
 * coping of private keys

I use the role as part of my common setup.

I hope it helps!

Requirements
===========

This role requires Ansible 1.4 or higher.

Tested and supported:
* Ubuntu saucy

Optional Variables
===========

These are the turning knobs and their default values, if you like to change em, just go ahead.

```lang
# group_vars/all.yml

ssl_certificates:
    - keys/www.example.com.cert # copy from ansible project folder
    - /Users/user/.certs/keys/mail.example.com.cert # copy from absolute path
ssl_private_keys:
    - keys/www.example.com.key # copy from ansible project folder
    - /Users/user/.certs/keys/mail.example.com.key # copy from absolute path
```

Examples
===========

Like so you can include the role in your setup:

```lang
# playbook.yml

- { role: lxhunter.certficates }
```
