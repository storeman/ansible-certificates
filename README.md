Description
===========

`certificates` is an ansible role which was built to help you with:

 * coping of certficates
 * coping of private keys
 * storing encrypted private keys

I use the role as part of my common setup.

I hope it helps!

Requirements
===========

This role requires Ansible 1.4 or higher.

Tested and supported:
* Ubuntu saucy

Optional Variables
===========

These are the turning knobs and their default values, if you like to change em, just go ahead.

```lang
# group_vars/all.yml

ssl_certificates:
    - keys/www.example.com.cert # copy from ansible project folder
    - /Users/user/.certs/keys/mail.example.com.cert # copy from absolute path
ssl_private_keys:
    - keys/www.example.com.key # copy from ansible project folder
    - /Users/user/.certs/keys/mail.example.com.key # copy from absolute path

# Or define content, so you can encrypt this var file with ansible-vault
ssl_private_key_contents:
    - name: mykey.key
      content: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIJKAIBAAKCAgEA25qk2rd29s4Z6vTBs1gHznsNS9e3J/C87H5pX0zm0UJtyUfm
        +3hrX5Ag+U368OFO7XeR09iuWhae5FYe5GGFz7CRcIo29hLroXXQgh5cFfrmOdJw
        GCvASbVJhIES0Q/XifS2KNU72fTge7teCsqXo9RgNzNqGK7pgXutPQ8e9NF3NfZj
        XKJhzThde75Ih2Or36R7JKfNfq+jv9t8ulbSrlDltCXafo5+k/RdYtG8QhGKHTHW
        ...
        ...
        ...
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----  

```

Examples
===========

Like so you can include the role in your setup:

```lang
# playbook.yml

- { role: lxhunter.certficates }
```

Example with encrypted settings
===========

1. First, create a file with your private keys like ```mykeys.yml``` and enter the
settings ```ssl_private_key_contents``` variable
2. Encrypt the file using ansible-vault ```ansible-vault encrypt mykeys.yml```
3. Load the file before you use the role: ```
pre_tasks:
  - name: Load certificates
    include_vars: "certificates/mykeys.yml"
    no_log: true
roles:
  - storeman.certificates
```
4. Run your playbook, don't forget to pass the ```--ask-vault-pass``` parameter
